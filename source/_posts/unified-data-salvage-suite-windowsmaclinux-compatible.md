TOP USE CASES

## When to Use Stellar Toolkit for Data Recovery?

 Lost Data from Virtual Machine?

![Recovery-Pending-Due-to-Transaction-Log-Corruption](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog/usecase/sql-toolkit/Recovery-Pending-Due-to-Transaction-Log-Corruption.jpg)

 Data loss may happen on a virtual machine due to reasons such as unexpected shutdown, hypervisor malfunction, or human error. Stellar data recovery toolkit can mount a virtual machine image (VMDK, VDI, VHD, and VHDX) and recover the lost data.

 Need to Recover Data from Inaccessible RAID?

![Need-to-Recover-Data-from-Inaccessible-RAID](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog/usecase/data-recovery-toolkit/Need-to-Recover-Data-from-Inaccessible-RAID.png)

 A RAID may turn inaccessible due to controller failure, disk errors, disk failure, etc. leading to data loss. The toolkit can rebuild the RAID & scan the RAID volume to recover data. It can also create a virtual drive to allow data recovery, if it is not feasible to rebuild the RAID.

 Need to Recover Data from Synology NAS?

![Need-to-Recover-Data-from-a-Crashed-System](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/v7/Recovers-Data-from-Synology-NAS-Server.png)

 Recovering data from a Synology NAS RAID configuration can be a challenging and delicate process. Data loss can occur on a Synology NAS due to various reasons, such as controller failure, disk errors, and system failures. The Stellar Data Recovery Toolkit can efficiently and effectively recover data from a Synology drive formatted in BTRFS.

 KEY FEATURES OF Stellar Toolkit for Data Recovery

### Software Important Capabilities

![Recovers from All Types of Storage Drive](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//featureicon/toolkit-for-data-recovery/Recovers-from-All-Types-of-Storage-Drive.png)

### Recovers from All Types of Storage Drive

 Stellar Data Recovery toolkit is designed for all types of storage drives, including hard drive and solid state drive, USB flash memory, hybrid storage, portable drive, memory card, optical storage, Synology drives etc. It can also recover data from BitLocker® encrypted drive, after you enter the BitLocker password or Startup key.

![Recovers from RAID 0, RAID 5, & RAID 6](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//featureicon/toolkit-for-data-recovery/Recover-Data-from-RAID-0-RAID-5-and-RAID-6-arrays.png)

### Recovers from RAID 0, RAID 5, & RAID 6

 The toolkit can reconstruct an inaccessible RAID array by using parameters such as disk order, start sector of RAID, stripe/block size, etc., and then scan the RAID volume to recover the data. Further, it can provide the probable values for RAID construction, when the parameters are unknown, thus allowing data recovery.

![Constructs Virtual RAID for Data Recovery](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//featureicon/toolkit-for-data-recovery/Constructs-Virtual-RAID-for-Data-Recovery.png)

### Constructs Virtual RAID for Data Recovery

 In worst-case scenarios, the software allows to create a virtual drive if it is unable to rebuild a RAID or find the volume. It then performs RAW recovery, i.e. file signature-based search of lost data in the RAID volume image, and retrieves the data.

![Recovers from Virtual Machine](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//featureicon/toolkit-for-data-recovery/Recovers-from-Virtual-Machine.png)

### Recovers from Virtual Machine

 The toolkit also recovers data from a virtual machine by mounting the VM image and scanning it like a physical storage. It can scan the visible partitions of the virtual machine or can also search and find the missing partitions, and scan those to retrieve the data. The toolkit can recover data from VMDK, VDI, VHD and VHDX images.

Other Important Features

### Know your product Better

![Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux Storage](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//featureicon/toolkit-for-data-recovery/Supports-Windows-macOS-and-Linux-Storage.png)

#### Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux Storage

 The software can recover data from Windows storage media based on NTFS, FAT16, FAT32, exFAT file system. It also supports macOS storage, including APFS, HFS, HFS+ drives. And, the tool also restores the data from Linux storage having Ext4, Ext3, & Ext2 file systems.

![Retrieves Data from Crashed System](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//featureicon/toolkit-for-data-recovery/Retrieves-Data-from-Crashed-System.png)

#### Retrieves Data from Crashed System

 The tool can create bootable media to access and recover data from a crashed or unbootable Windows PC or Mac. The bootable recovery media allows seamless access to the unbootable system, just like a working system, scans the hard drive or start-up disk and recovers the data.

![Recovers Data from Synology NAS Server.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/v7/Recovers-from-RAID-configured-NAS.png)

#### Recovers Data from Synology NAS Server

 The Stellar Data Recovery toolkit can recover data from Synology BTRFS. The software can restore all file types and formats from RAID 0, 1, 5, 6, 10, and SHR. The advanced feature for NAS data recovery can restore data from RAID-based NAS systems.

![Recovers Lost or Missing Partition](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//featureicon/toolkit-for-data-recovery/Recovers-Lost-or-Missing-Partition.png)

#### Recovers Lost or Missing Partition

 The software can discover the lost or deleted partitions on a storage drive by using an option called ‘Can’t Find Drive’ which involves scanning of the storage drive, particularly to search the lost and deleted partitions. This feature can also run Deep Scan, a file signature-based media scanning technology, to recover the partitions.
