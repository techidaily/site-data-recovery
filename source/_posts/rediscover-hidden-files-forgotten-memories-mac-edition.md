[How long does a software scan take for data recovery on Mac?](#collapseeight)

 The scanning time would depend on several factors, namely, size and condition of the Mac storage drive, processing speed of your system, type of scan (Deep Scan/Quick Scan), and filters you’ve selected via the software interface.

 For instance, if you’ve selected Deep Scan, the software will check every single block on the drive to completely rebuild the lost information, which will take more time compared to Quick Scan.

 For efficient data recovery, it’s recommended to apply filters to select the type of data (Photo, Video, Audio, etc.) and file format (such as JPEG, BMP, etc.), if known, to reduce the overall scanning time.
