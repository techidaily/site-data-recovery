### FAQ

[How to recover lost or deleted partitions?](#collapseOne)

To recover lost or deleted partitions, use “Can’t Find Drive” option on “Recover From” screen. The steps to do so are as follows:

1. Download and install the partition recovery software.
2. Run the software and choose the type of data to be recovered from “Select What to Recover” screen by placing a checkmark on the desired checkboxes. Click on the ‘Next’ button.
3. Select “Can’t Find Drive” from “Recover From” screen by checking the respective checkbox (or from the bottom left corner of the interface). Click ‘Scan.’
4. After selecting a physical drive from “Select Hard Drive to Search Lost Partition”, turn On/Off ‘Extensive Search’ option—to allow the software to perform a thorough scan of the drive—then click ‘Scan.’
5. After completion of the scan, the “Search Completed Successfully!” message box appears. Click ‘Close’. The software lists all the found partitions.
6. On the “Select Partition to Recover Data” screen, select a partition then click Scan.
7. On the “Scanning Completed Successfully!” message box, click ‘Close.’ Proceed with file preview and data recovery.

[How to find a specific file format in the list of supported formats?](#collapsetwo)

To find a specific file format in the list of supported formats, perform the following steps:

1. Run the volume recovery utility by double-clicking on its icon.
2. Click on the ‘Advanced Settings’ icon that is present on the toolbar.
3. Select the ‘File List’ icon. A ‘File List’ screen opens that contains all supported file types.
4. Choose the desired file types and proceed with the recovery process.
5. If the desired file type is not present in the list, click ‘Add File Type’ icon to add custom file types.

[How to recover inaccessible volumes from a damaged MBR disk?](#collapsethree)

To recover inaccessible volumes from a damaged MBR (Master Boot Record) disk, use any of the following methods:

**Method 1**: Create a USB recovery drive, steps are as follows:

1. Run the data recovery software on another working PC.
2. Connect an empty USB flash drive.
3. Choose the “Create Recovery Drive” option from the bottom left corner or from the “More Tools” menu present on the top right corner.
4. Select the drive and let the software create a recovery drive.
  
Once the USB recovery drive is created, connect it to the affected PC then power on the system. Use the data recovery software that runs from the recovery drive—to scan and recover inaccessible volumes and its stored content.

**Method 2**: Disconnect the damaged hard disk from your PC (if possible) and attach it to another Windows PC that has this volume recovery software installed on it. Then, run the software and carry out the defined process to recover inaccessible volumes from your damaged disk that is now connected as an external drive to the PC.

[What is partition recovery and why it is needed?](#collapsefour)

A partition is a section of a storage drive that has fixed storage capacity to store data. Every partition is assigned with a unique letter, say C, D, E, etc. Further, each partition has a file system linked with it, such as FAT, exFAT, and NTFS. These formatted partitions (also known as volumes) can get lost because of deletion or reinstallation of Windows. In such situations, perform partition recovery to salvage all the lost partitions and its contained data.

Leverage the partition recovery software to restore photos, audio, videos, documents, emails, databases, backups, or any other files that were lost. The software can recover data from NTFS, FAT, and exFAT formatted partitions.

[Can I recover a specific volume by using the software?](#collapsefive)

Yes. You can recover a specific volume by using this software.

[The software is taking a long time to scan my drive. What can I do now?](#collapsesix)

If the software takes a long time to scan, check whether Deep Scan option on the ‘Recover From’ screen and Preview feature on the Scan screen is turned ON or OFF. If they are ON, turn one or both of them OFF to speed up the scan process.

[I see Deep Scan toggle switch, whether I should turn it on or off?](#collapseseven)

When the Deep Scan toggle switch is OFF, the software performs quick scan of the selected storage drive. And, when it is ON, the software performs Deep Scan. From the two scan modes: Quick and Deep, you should try Quick Scan first. If you find the desired data or partition in the scan result, you don’t need to try Deep Scan. However, if the desired data or partition is not found, you must go for Deep Scan.

[I still don’t find the solution to my query. Whom should I contact?](#collapseeight)

If you do not find the solution to your query, you can contact our Technical Support team that is available 24\*5.
