## Discover Which Prebuilt Desktop for Gamers Matches Your Needs Best

Building a custom gaming PC is great. Some folks love to get into the nitty-gritty, finding the perfect components to match the latest benchmark-pushing masterpiece. But that isn't for everyone. A lot of people just want something that will play everything they want while still functioning as the center of their creative lives.

 That's why these three premium PC series from[MSI](https://us.msi.com/) are great options. They're prebuilt desktops that can save you the stress of figuring out part compatibility and build time, but still provide the DIY feel a lot of gamers have come to expect from their rigs. They're each customizable, so you can almost certainly find one to suit your needs. Plus, they're built with upgrades in mind, so when you find yourself needing a more impressive graphics card in the future, that won't be an issue.

Which one is right for you, though? Time to meet the contestants.

## Codex R2 14th

 Picking the right starter PC is vital. You don't want something completely overwhelming, but it should have enough under the hood to keep you hooked. A great option for entry-level gamers is the[Codex R2 14th](https://msi.gm/S8CEE8AA) . This machine will get you out of the box and into the action with an Intel® Core™ i7 processor. It supports Wi-Fi 7, so you'll be ready to take on your foes with ultra-low latency.

 Maybe most important, though, is the new cooling system. Keeping this computer crisp is a mesh-style front-panel design, a major airflow improvement over previous generations. Plus, the MSI Frozr AI Cooling will adjust the fan speed as it learns your habits, keeping the noise low and the performance high.
