## Codex R2 14th

 Picking the right starter PC is vital. You don't want something completely overwhelming, but it should have enough under the hood to keep you hooked. A great option for entry-level gamers is the[Codex R2 14th](https://msi.gm/S8CEE8AA) . This machine will get you out of the box and into the action with an Intel® Core™ i7 processor.
