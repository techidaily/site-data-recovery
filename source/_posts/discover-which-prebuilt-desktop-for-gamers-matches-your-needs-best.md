## Codex R2 14th

 Picking the right starter PC is vital. You don't want something completely overwhelming, but it should have enough under the hood to keep you hooked. A great option for entry-level gamers is the[Codex R2 14th](https://msi.gm/S8CEE8AA) . This machine will get you out of the box and into the action with an Intel® Core™ i7 processor. It supports Wi-Fi 7, so you'll be ready to take on your foes with ultra-low latency.

 Maybe most important, though, is the new cooling system. Keeping this computer crisp is a mesh-style front-panel design, a major airflow improvement over previous generations. Plus, the MSI Frozr AI Cooling will adjust the fan speed as it learns your habits, keeping the noise low and the performance high.
