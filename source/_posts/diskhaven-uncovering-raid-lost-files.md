FIND YOUR ANSWERS

### FAQ

[Do I need to rebuild the RAID array before performing the recovery operation?](#collapseOne)

 Yes, it is necessary to reconstruct the RAID. Stellar RAID Data Recovery software verifies the consistency of data in the reconstructed RAID drives. Only after rebuilding the RAID, you will get probable RAID constructions, on which you can perform various data recovery operations to recover your data.

[I don't remember the RAID parameters set to my RAID array. Is there any alternative option in Stellar Windows RAID Data Recovery Software to rebuild the RAID array?](#collapsetwo)

 It is suggested to enter the RAID parameters, if you exactly remember them. Wrong information can mislead the software and lessens the data recovery chances. However, if you don't at all remember the RAID parameters, the software provides option to mention 'Don't Know' in the field given and choose all possible options for the corresponding parameter. In such a case, this RAID hard drive recovery software searches for all specified parameter options and create the probable RAID constructions.

[Can I recover my deleted data from the RAID drive?](#collapsethree)

 Yes, you can easily recover all your deleted or formatted data from the RAID drives. Once you rebuild the RAID, you can select and scan the drives or the virtual RAID drive. Once the scan gets completed, select the files you want to recover from the scanned list. Then select 'Recover', choose the destination and click 'Start Saving'.

[My RAID array has been severely corrupt and is unable to rebuild. Can I recover data from the array using Stellar RAID recovery software?](#collapsefour)

 Yes, the software is able to recover data from such a condition. There are many situations, when two or more RAID drives get logically corrupt and the normal rebuild operation fails. Stellar Data Recovery Technician software is especially designed for such instances of severe RAID array corruption and efficiently recovers all your data from the troubled drives.

[Do I need the RAID controller card to recover data from the RAID drives?](#collapsefive)

 No, there is no need to have the RAID controller card while recovering data from the troubled RAID Drives using RAID recovery software by Stellar.

[What to do if the software fails to create probable RAID construction and no volume is found?](#collapsesix)

 If the software fails to create probable RAID construction, the software shows another option – 'Create Virtual Drive'. You can still perform this virtual RAID drive, perform raw recovery, and search for the lost volumes in it.

[Do I need all the member RAID drives for performing data recovery from a RAID array?](#collapseseven)

 Yes, in order to perform RAID Recovery, the software requires all your member RAID drives. You also need to specify proper sequencing of these drives for successful recovery.

[Is it possible to recover data from a reformatted RAID 5 volume?](#collapseeight)

 Yes, most of the times, the data is recoverable after re-formatting the RAID 5 volume, depending upon the way that how you’ll re-format the drive. Using Windows, if we do a re-formatting of a volume, then, it will create what exactly appear to a ‘clean’ new volume; but, the original data will still appear on the disk in the ‘Free and Available’ space. However, a low-level format, which has been performed by the RAID controller utility will completely ‘Wipe’ overwrite every single block on a drive. A low-level format is slower than high – level format.

[I have accidentally deleted a partition in Disk Management and now the partition is not visible, will this software be able to recover data from that partition?](#collapsenine)

 If you have deleted a partition then you can easily recover it using the ‘Can’t Find Drive’ feature of the RAID drive recovery software.

[Does this software recover data from my damaged NAS?](#collapseten)

 Yes, if the NAS is based on RAID 0,5 or 6 then this software can recover your data, you just need to specify the parameters and if you don’t know them then you can use the ‘Don’t Know start sector of drives ’ feature.

[What can be the reasons of RAID Data Corruption and Failure?](#collapsetenv1)

A RAID system can fail and data becomes inaccessible due to:

* RAID Controller Failure
* Multiple RAID Hard disk Failure
* Intermittent drive failure resulting in RAID degradation
* Accidental reformatting of drives or whole RAID array
* Failed Rebuild or Lost RAID Array configuration etc.
* Immediate RAID Server Crash due to Power issues
* Application/software corruption etc.

[What File Types does this RAID array data recovery software supports?](#collapseeleven)

 Stellar Data Recovery Technician supports 300+ file types and allows you to add additional file types apart from those already mentioned in File Lists. Using Add Header option, user can add a new file type or edit an existing file type to facilitate the RAID data recovery process.

[What is the importance of using Drive Monitor?](#collapsetwoelve)

 The importance of using Drive Monitor is that you can use it to prevent drive failure or corruption of your drive by regularly checking the health, performance and current temperature. If you notice that the health and performance of drives are low, clone your hard drive to remove bad sectors. The reason being, bad sectors in hard drives are a leading cause of poor health and performance.

[I lost my data from a 4K drive. Can I get it back using Stellar data recovery software?](#collapse13)

 Yes, you can recover the data lost from 4K hard drives using Stellar data recovery software. The tool works with all leading make and models of 4K drives/

[I work on a dual monitor setup. Is it possible to run this tool on dual screens?](#collapse14)

 Yes, the software fully supports dual-screen setups and enables a native data recovery experience.
